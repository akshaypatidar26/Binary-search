1. **Searching an element in a sorted array**  [ Solution ](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Binary-search/blob/master/Binary%20search%20solutions/Searching%20an%20element%20in%20a%20sorted%20array)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/) 
```
Given a sorted array arr[] of N integers and a number K is given. The task is to check if the element K is present in the array or not.
```
2. **First and last occurrences of X**  [ Solution ](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Binary-search/blob/master/Binary%20search%20solutions/First%20and%20last%20occurrences%20of%20X)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-and-last-positions-of-an-element-in-a-sorted-array/) 
```
Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
```

4. **Find the Rotation Count in Rotated Sorted array** [Solution]()
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-rotation-count-rotated-sorted-array/)
```
Given a sorted array A of size N. The array is rotated 'K' times. Find the value of 'K'. The array may contain duplicate elements.
```
5. **Floor in a Sorted Array** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Binary-search/blob/master/Binary%20search%20solutions/Floor%20in%20a%20Sorted%20Array)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floor-in-a-sorted-array/)
```
Given a sorted array arr[] of size N without duplicates, and given a value x. Find the floor of x in given array. Floor of x is defined as the largest element K in arr[] such that K is smaller than or equal to x.
